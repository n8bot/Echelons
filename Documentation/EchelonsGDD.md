# Introduction

### Prompts to ChatGPT

(from `What is a good outline for a game design document for a first-time solo developer who might collaborate with a few people at times`)

The game is called Echelons of Deception and Survival, and it s a third-person competitive online RPG with elements of survival and battle-royale, social-stealth mechanics,  immersive sim economic simulation, and serious/non-serious RP.

It is a third-person online-only competitive survival battle-royal RPG immersive sim with two main game modes: Last One Standing and Team Target Elimination, and a third free-mode for casual serious and non-serious RP. The first setting that will be introduced as the only setting of the first version of the game will be a Martian gambling resort colony. The gameplay involves roleplaying jobs and tasks around the colony, mostly ultimately catering to the few elite VIP guests. Survival mechanics involve eating, sleeping, etc. There is an effort to discourage the use of direct pvp violence with guns etc, but that potential is always there. The identities of player-controlled opponents is not explicitly revealed. There is an element of mystery in determining who is a player or just an AI-controlled character. There is also strategy surrounding concealment of your identity as a player-controlled character. And, as always, even the player-controlled characters will be driven by game AI automatically. The player can choose to subtly make small decisions without fully overriding control, or if they make too much of a decision or take full control of the character, the player must remain in control until the player gets a full nights rest or takes some psychoactive medication. Some of the roles and jobs that the characters will need to fill are shopkeeper, cook/chef/waiter/food service, weapons manufacturing, robot manufacturing, facility maintenance, garbage removal, sewage system maintenance, logistics (importing goods from earth). There are some upper level roles such as VIP host and security manager, but they are not starting roles for the players. The physical security is all taken care of by extremely lethal humanoid robots. These robots also serve as the rules of play for the gambling operation: robot battle arena. Simple wagers are placed on the outcomes of robot battles. The entire colony is built upon this gambling operation. Massive energy and money is spent keeping this running. Perhaps, in secrecy, some of these robots and weapons are being manufactured in excess and potentially used for some other purpose or sold for profit. This is one of the meanings of the "Echelons of Deception." The entire colony is essential a giant deception, with layers of deception at every layer in between. The rules of the colony will disallow any human from possessing weapons, but of course some people are criminals and will possess them anyway, and some people are VIP and are deemed so important that rules basically don't apply. The rules become very selectively enforced: mostly as a way to keep the poor servants of the lower echelons of the colony in check.

(There is also maybe a third game mode, hitperson, where each player is given a hit list of people, without any knowledge of who is player or AI, and so each player has all the other players on their list but they don't know which ones...)
