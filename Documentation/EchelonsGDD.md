2. It is a third-person online-only competitive survival battle-royal RPG immersive sim with two main game modes: Last One Standing and Team Target Elimination, and a third free-mode for casual serious and non-serious RP. The first setting that will be introduced as the only setting of the first version of the game will be a Martian gambling resort colony. The gameplay involves roleplaying jobs and tasks around the colony, mostly ultimately catering to the few elite VIP guests. Survival mechanics involve eating, sleeping, etc. There is an effort to discourage the use of direct pvp violence with guns etc, but that potential is always there. The identities of player-controlled opponents is not explicitly revealed. There is an element of mystery in determining who is a player or just an AI-controlled character. There is also strategy surrounding concealment of your identity as a player-controlled character. And, as always, even the player-controlled characters will be driven by game AI automatically. The player can choose to subtly make small decisions without fully overriding control, or if they make too much of a decision or take full control of the character, the player must remain in control until the player gets a full nights rest or takes some psychoactive medication. Some of the roles and jobs that the characters will need to fill are shopkeeper, cook/chef/waiter/food service, weapons manufacturing, robot manufacturing, facility maintenance, garbage removal, sewage system maintenance, logistics (importing goods from earth). There are some upper level roles such as VIP host and security manager, but they are not starting roles for the players. The physical security is all taken care of by extremely lethal humanoid robots. These robots also serve as the rules of play for the gambling operation: robot battle arena. Simple wagers are placed on the outcomes of robot battles. The entire colony is built upon this gambling operation. Massive energy and money is spent keeping this running. Perhaps, in secrecy, some of these robots and weapons are being manufactured in excess and potentially used for some other purpose or sold for profit. This is one of the meanings of the "Echelons of Deception." The entire colony is essential a giant deception, with layers of deception at every layer in between. The rules of the colony will disallow any human from possessing weapons, but of course some people are criminals and will possess them anyway, and some people are VIP and are deemed so important that rules basically don't apply. The rules become very selectively enforced: mostly as a way to keep the poor servants of the lower echelons of the colony in check.

    1. Resource management will be particularly important, as weapons and ammunition will be scarce and extremely lethal.

They would encounter resistance from the robot guards, but they could also perhaps be defeated or disabled with some type of strategy. As players move from one character to another as they die, they could perform different actions as each character to set up a favorable scenario for them to win as a subsequent character.

    1. In this revised version of the game, players will assume the roles of characters in a small, capitalistically-run martian colony that serves as a ~~tourist destination and~~ casino-style resort. The colony is home to 32 characters, each loosely modeled after a chess piece or pawn, and is run by a group of players and AI-controlled characters. The Kings and Queens are the wealthy, high-rolling guests of the casino, while the Rooks represent "the house" and serve as VIP hosts to the whales. The Bishops are business owners who control private interests in the colony's food, shopping, and other facilities, and the Knights are in charge of security and the maintenance of the robots that provide physical protection and policing for the colony. The Pawns are low-skilled workers who tend to the shops, restaurants, and other facilities, as well as performing all the manual labor required to run the colony, including tasks such as weapons maintenance, robot repair, and facility maintenance.

    1. This is a competitive online multiplayer game, in which players compete to be the last character standing in the colony. Players must navigate the ~~complex~~ social dynamics of the colony and use social stealth to avoid drawing attention to themselves, while also trying to sabotage the duties of other characters and cause disasters that will eliminate their opponents. Players start as a randomly-assigned character and are given a role or job within the colony. The duties and tasks for the character are performed automatically by the AI unless the player takes control of the character and overrides the AI's actions. Players can take control of their character at any time, but the control does not end until the character gets a full night's sleep. Once the character wakes up, the AI will resume control of the character and continue performing its duties and tasks.

    1. Players observe the actions and behaviors of the other characters, including both player-controlled and AI-controlled characters, in order to try and deduce which ones are controlled by other players and which ones are controlled by the AI. Players make strategic decisions about how to interact with the other characters, based on their personalities and the goals of their own character, and try to survive in the colony for as long as possible.

### New Notes

#### Ontology

Ontology plays a large part of the themes and tone of the game. The ontology will be precise, yet ambiguous. As in, each use of a term will be well defined, but there will be many uses of a single term all of which can only be determined based on context.

E.g., the word echelon itself. It will be used to describe so many things — upper and lower echelon character roles, numbered echelons of player deaths, referring to physical stories of a building, referring to other individual objects. There could be several ways to use these different terms. Upper/lower echelon, echelon 1, 2, 3, or 4. First echelon/Second echelon. Echelon A, B, C. Your echelon, their echelon.

This kind of ambiguous wordplay will be everywhere.


#### Tortoise-TTS

Text to speech using [TorToiSe](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts)?

Oh wow yes.


#### Host Migration

If a player dropped out early, and they happened to be the host, the game is ruined. We should plan for host migration, dedicated servers, or have all players in session share hosting duties. Every client is also a server? Madness.


#### Personality Traits

Perhaps a simple positive/negative binary personality trait is determined for each AI character. It could be called "toxic personality" vs wholesome (or sweetheart).


#### In the end quote

~~"In the end, it was echelons upon echelons of deception. Always has been."~~ "In the end, it was all Echelons of Deception and Survival the whole way down, always has been."


#### Last One Standing Game Mode additional scoring

Perhaps the total duration of time alive of all characters boosts the absolute score of any players in the game. Relative score, for the single game, is simply last one standing - times died. Across all games, the duration of all characters in an individual game, determines the overall absolute score placement across all games (of equivalent versions — leaderboards will be reset for gameplay changes).


#### Speech-to-text for AI

Whisper.cpp for speech recognition for AI characters to detect spoken words.

### Collections of Pre-existing Notes

Below is a collection of notes about the game.


### Notebook Notes

These notes are transcribed from handwritten notes, in the order they appear in the notebook. The order is not logical.


#### Unsorted

- Roles mapped to chess pieces — 32 Characters total
  - Upper echelon: Kings, Queens, Rooks, Knights, Bishops — VIP Whales, Operations Management, Security Management, Small Business Operators
  - Lower echelon: Pawns — Workers
- Mental health is modeled with medication as a pickup to buff/debuff certain stats simultaneously (restores mental health with side effects)
- Picture the routines of all the specific jobs/roles
- Characters must sleep  
  - While sleeping characters/players can use their electornic device (phone, "mental probe" implant, etc.) to perform online shopping and other activities
  - AI-controlled characters can also do this automatically to some extent
  - This mechanic adds to the narrative as well as gives players something to do when the character is sleeping
  - Perhaps sleeping pills are required to do activities while sleeping
  - Maybe other types of pills allow a character to forgoe sleep with some debuff side-effect
- Maybe the Knights are more like dedicated security/bodyguards for the VIP whales
- Currency? Digital/Cash?
  - "Mars Credits"?
  - Proxy?
    - Diamonds?
    - Bullets?
    - Pills?
    - Spices?
    - Booze?
- Chat? Voice? Text?
  - "SMS" via phone or "mental probe" implant?

- Player-paid billboard ads?
- Business reviews?
  - Message to/from businesses?
- Random business names
  - Players name theirs
- Battery on phone or "mental probe" implant depletes
- Camera movement lags AI movement?
- Phone/ID Device can be lost/stolen
  - Phone/ID Device is issued by the casino/house/management/colony
- Entire facility is put under lock down, red lights and sirens, if any glass is broken of the dome, etc.
  - Roof glass breaking mechanism: multiple layers of glass. Shards of glass rain down on characters causing damage. Red alert, lockdown. Always explained away as thankfully all the layers didn't break. Technical side: Glass planels never do break, they just spawn shards of glass for simplicity.
- Throwing system
  - Physical properties like hardness, weight, etc., affect trajectory and damage


#### What is the angle/take of the colony?

- Simply scamming the colonists with exchange rates sending money from earth, converting to Mars Credits and no facility to transfer back to Earth currency.
- Casino/House manipulated the digital currency?
  - Printing money?
- Ulon Mars is the mastermind
  - Mars Gambling Resort, LLC owns and operates entire facility except small independent businesses (which are owned by Mars Gambling Resort, but operated and rented by the Bishops/whomever)
    - VIP Guests Bring the money to keep the wheels greased — tons of it
      - Workers do all the work — tons of it
        - Robots combat as a basis for gambling and as physical security/police.
- "Amazing.com" PRIMO account gives you one-day delivery to Mars from their off-world distribution centers
  - Prices are inflated because Mars
- There is a weapons manufacturing facility and a humanoid robot manufacturing facility
- Ulon Mars has ulterior motives for the entire operation. There is an ultimate echelon of deception which is revealed for the first time when the player is victorious in a round.


#### Monetization

- MTX for players to be able to offer special items *for-sale* in their in-game shops
  - Has gameplay implications — users without assets will not be able to offer certain items for sale, and could reveal their identity easier


#### Mapping to Chess Moves

- Pawn — Worker: limited movement, but with a sneaky en-passant (the strategy employed by players)
- Bishop — Small Business Operators: large range of motion in a certain direction, limited to its domain (some special access, but not an "insider")
- Knight — Special Security: range is limited by policy, but can "pick" targets with special access (like jumping over pieces)
- Rook — House: large range of motion, domain is not limited — all access privileges
- Queen — VIP subset: nearly-unlimited range of motion, but ultimately tied to the King and their limitless resources (charm their way anywhere)
- King — VIP subset: debilitated by the stress and burden of the colony — remorse, sense of being scammed, shame, addictions, mental/physical health problems


#### Unsorted

- Package inspection game mechanic/duty/task/ability
  - A certain role or set of roles has the authority to inspect individual packages in logistics at will, searching for contraband or for any other purpose
  - Package contents are physically laid out and the individual items can be interacted with like normal
- The Weenie is the large structure at the center of the colony, which serves multiple purposes and is a very tall tower
  - The base of the Weenie holds the Emergency Escape Balls which will launch VIPs to safety in case of danger
    - They VIPs climb inside, and are launched into the air, away from the colony, and land back to safety on the Martian surface gently via parachute
      - They will never function when a person is inside — they will parachute perfectly every time they are launched empty
  - The Weenie also supports the protective cup — the glass dome around the colony, which provides the physical barrier to the deadly Martian atmosphere
- Possible mental model of AI/Characters whereby they self-rank themselves in terms of superiority — modelling complexes of narcissists and the opposite
- Mandatory "mental probe" implants (neurolink)


#### Game Types

- Last One Standing
- Team Target Elimination
- Hitpeople
  - All players are secretly hit persons. Crazy Ulon Mars has given them all tailored hit lists which contain some AI characters and also all other player characters, but without knowledge of which is which. Winner is the first to complete their list without getting hitted.

### Discord Ramblings

- going to try and model the npc ai using Maslow's hierarchy, the biopsychosocial model, and the stress and coping model of human behaviour.
- I think the game name will be Ulon Mars
  - and ppl can joke, like they act confused when they hear the name and someone is like "Yeah he changed his name" and they're like oooh yeah yeah ok but we never say the old name lol

Can you help me brainstorm job ideas for a role playing multiplayer video game? It will simulate a small martian colony which is run capitalistically as a ~~tourist destination: a~~ casino-style resort that hosts robot gun battles which can be gambled on. There are 32 characters, each vaguely modelled off the 32 chess pieces and pawns. The Kings and Queens are merely the whale guests of the casino. They have been sold a one-way ticket to live the rest of their lives in luxury, gambling on robot battles on mars. The other members of the colony are the people who facilitate the running of the colony. The Rooks represent "the house" and are the VIP hosts to the whales. They are also basically in charge of the whole operation. Then, the bishops are represented as the business owners who hold private interest over the food, shopping, and other facilities of the small martian colony. The Knights are in charge of security, but they don't themselves perform any policing duties. Robots take care of all direct policing: arresting and protecting with weapons. The pawns are all the low-skilled workers, who tend to the shops and restaurants of the colony, as well as all the manual labour required to run the operation: weapons technician, robot technician, electricty/power generation and distribution, facility maintenance, plumbing, glass repair, etc. I need help determining which roles will be essential to the operation of the colony, and provide interesting, dynamic, and fun gameplay for the players and characters.

Thank you. Keep in mind, this is a small colony on mars. There are only 32 people in total, and the area is small enough that they can walk everywhere. No transportation or cars or vehicles are needed. With that in mind, do you have any more ideas for shops, services, amenities, or essential systems on the colony that would be required for survival?

> 
> 10. Community garden: The colony could have a community garden where residents can grow their own produce and plants.

How could all of these shops, services, systems, and amenities be presented to the player in a fun and challenging way? Keep in mind, we're making a multiplayer online game that is meant to be competitive. The players would possess the different characters to try and be the last one standing at the end of the round. The score of the players will take into account the number of times they died, and thus switched characters. The last person alive with the least number of deaths is the winner. They will be pre-occupied with survival tasks and other duties around the colony. What would the core game loop be?

> One way to present the various shops, services, systems, and amenities to the players in a fun and challenging way would be to have them complete tasks and missions related to these aspects of the colony. For example, players could be assigned tasks such as repairing a malfunctioning solar panel array, tending to the plants in the hydroponics farm, or conducting research in the laboratory.
> 
> In order to make the game more competitive, players could be given rewards for completing tasks ~~and missions~~ successfully, such as ~~points or~~ in-game currency. These rewards could be used to purchase upgrades or items that will help the player survive longer in the game.
> 
> The core game loop could involve players completing tasks ~~and missions~~ to earn rewards, while also trying to survive as long as possible by avoiding dangers such as attacks from other players or malfunctioning equipment. The player who lasts the longest and has the fewest deaths would be the winner.
> 
> To make the game more dynamic and interesting, the tasks ~~and missions~~ could be randomly generated or changed on a regular basis, so that players always have something new to do. The colony could also have events ~~or challenges~~ that take place periodically, such as robot battles ~~or survival challenges~~, which would provide players with additional opportunities to earn rewards and compete against each other.

Describe the game in full.

> In this role-playing multiplayer video game, players take on the roles of characters in a small Martian colony that is run as a capitalist resort ~~and tourist destination~~. The colony features a casino-style resort that hosts robot gun battles which can be gambled on, as well as a variety of shops, services, and amenities such as restaurants, bars, spas, and fitness centers.

The players do not choose the role. They start as a random pawn, who as a randomly-assigned job. The players can change roles only when their current character dies. They then possess the nearest character who is not already possessed by another player.

> Understood. This adds an additional layer of strategy and risk to the game, as players will need to carefully consider their actions and the potential consequences of those actions. For example, a player may need to weigh the benefits of taking on a high-risk ~~mission~~ with the possibility of a big reward against the risk of losing their current character and having to start ~~over~~ with a new one.

There is less of a focus on combat. No human characters will be authorized to have weapons, except when providing them to the robots. The robots will provide the physical security. The knights are merely in charge of all the robots. The economic simulation of the game is a key factor. The players actions in performing their task have impacts on the overall economic scenario. If players sabotage their duties. they can indirectly attack opponent players.

Social stealth will also play a key role in the game. None of the other players are explicitly labelled for the other players. The AI-controlled characters and the player-controlled characters appear the same. A large part of the game will be deducing who is a player character or an AI character, and attempting to hamper the player characters. A player wants their opponents to die more times than they do, so they can be winner at the end. But, directly attacking players will cause the robot guards to quickly defeat the attacking player. Weapons will be scarce in the game, and ammo scarce as well. So lots of deep. covert strategy will be needed to win. Also, there will be a black market that provides goods and services to the characters. Any ideas how to implement that?

> It sounds like the game will have a strong focus on economic simulation and social stealth, with players having to carefully manage their tasks and resources while also attempting to gather information about their opponents and hinder their progress.
> 
> To implement the black market, one option could be to have it operate as a separate system within the game that is accessed through a covert interface. Players could use the black market to purchase or sell illegal or rare items, such as weapons or ammunition, at a premium price. Access to the black market could be gained ~~through completing certain tasks or missions, or~~ by earning favor with certain NPCs within the colony.
> 
> ~~To make the game more challenging and interesting, the black market could be operated by a group of NPCs who are more difficult to deal with than the regular characters in the colony.

> 
> In addition to the black market, the game could also have other covert systems or activities that players can engage in, such as hacking into the colony's computer systems or sabotaging equipment. These activities could provide players with an edge in the game, but could also come with risks if they are caught by the robot guards or other players.

> Overall, the game could be a mix of economic simulation, social stealth, and resource management, with players having to balance the need to perform their duties and gather resources with the need to gather information and hinder their opponents in order to emerge as the ultimate winner.

There will be no quests or missions beyond the basic economic duties of the roles assigned to the character at the time. The story will be emergent based on the actions taken by player-controlled characters. The AI-controlled characters will mostly perform their tasks diligently, although some of them will secretly operate in the black market. The AI and Player characters all perform the same actions and tasks, to make the job of distinguishing the two more difficult.

> Understood. In this case, the game could focus on the emergent story and interactions between the player-controlled and AI-controlled characters as they go about their tasks and duties within the colony. Players would need to carefully observe the actions and behaviors of the other characters in order to try and deduce which ones are controlled by other players and which ones are controlled by the AI.
> 
> To make the game more challenging and interesting, the AI-controlled characters could have different personalities and behaviors that reflect their role within the colony. For example, the Bishops who are business owners could be more calculating and selfish, while the Pawns who are low-skilled workers could be more desperate and willing to take risks.
> 
> The game could also have a variety of events or encounters that occur randomly or on a regular basis, which could provide players with opportunities to gather information or disrupt the plans of their opponents. For example, a malfunctioning piece of equipment could cause a temporary shutdown of a key facility, forcing players to scramble to find a solution and possibly revealing information about who is behind the problem.
> 
> Overall, the game would involve a mix of social stealth, resource management, and observation as players try to gather information and outmaneuver their opponents in order to emerge as the ultimate winner.

How could these systems be modelled?

> There are several ways that the systems in this game could be modeled in order to create a challenging and dynamic experience for players.
> 
> One approach would be to use a simulation-based model, in which the various systems and activities within the colony are simulated in real time based on a set of rules and algorithms. For example, the hydroponics farm could be modeled to produce a certain amount of produce per day based on factors such as the number of plants being grown, the amount of water and nutrients available, and the ambient temperature and light conditions.
> 
> ~~Another approach could be to use a role-playing game (RPG)-style model, in which the various tasks and activities within the colony are structured as quests or missions that players can choose to undertake. These quests could be generated randomly or based on the actions and decisions of the players, and could involve tasks such as repairing equipment, conducting research, or interacting with NPCs.~~
> 
> ~~Alternatively, the game could use a combination of both approaches, with some systems being simulated in real time and others being structured as quests or missions. This would allow for a mix of dynamic, emergent gameplay and more structured, goal-oriented gameplay.~~
> 
> Overall, the key to modeling the systems in this game would be to create a balance between complexity and accessibility, so that players feel challenged and engaged, but are not overwhelmed by the various systems and mechanics. This could involve using a range of tools and techniques, such as simulation algorithms, random number generators, ~~and branching dialogue systems,~~ to create a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

We will take the fully-simulated approach. How can the personality system for the AI characters be modelled?

> To model the personalities of the AI characters in a fully-simulated game, one option could be to use a combination of rules and algorithms that govern their behavior and decision-making.
> 
> One approach could be to define a set of personality traits for each AI character, such as greed, ambition, kindness, or cowardice. These traits could be used to influence the decisions and actions of the AI characters, based on the context and circumstances they are facing. For example, an AI character with a greedy personality might be more likely to prioritize their own self-interest over the needs of the colony, while an AI character with a kind personality might be more willing to help others and put the needs of the colony first.
> 
> ~~Another approach could be to use a dialogue system to allow the AI characters to interact with each other and the player characters in a more natural and lifelike way. This could involve using branching dialogue options, where the AI characters have different responses based on their personality traits and the context of the conversation.~~
> 
> Overall, the key to modeling the personalities of the AI characters would be to create a range of realistic and believable behaviors and decision-making processes that are consistent with the personality traits of the characters.

There will be no branching dialogue, though there might be some limited transactional interaction between the characters. What would be the most important traits to model for the AI characters?

> In a game where there is no branching dialogue and limited transactional interaction between the characters, the most important traits to model for the AI characters would likely be those that influence their behavior and decision-making in a more general sense.
> 
> Some examples of important traits to consider might include:
> 
> 1. Loyalty: How loyal is the AI character to the colony and its goals? Are they more likely to prioritize their own interests or the interests of the colony?
> 
> 2. Greed: How greedy is the AI character? Are they more likely to prioritize their own financial gain over the needs of the colony?
> 
> 3. Altruism: How altruistic is the AI character? Are they more likely to help others and put the needs of the colony first?
> 
> 4. Aggression: How aggressive is the AI character? Are they more likely to take risks or be confrontational in order to achieve their goals?
> 
> 5. Cowardice: How cowardly is the AI character? Are they more likely to avoid risks and back down in the face of danger?
> 
> These traits could be used to influence the general behavior and decision-making of the AI characters, as well as their responses to events and challenges within the game. For example, an AI character with a greedy personality might be more likely to take risks in order to earn a financial reward, while an AI character with a cowardly personality might be more likely to avoid risks and stick to safer, more predictable tasks.
> 
> Overall, the key would be to create a range of believable and consistent personality traits that influence the behavior and decision-making of the AI characters in a meaningful way. This could help to make the game more immersive and dynamic, as players have to consider the personalities of the AI characters in their interactions with them.

How can we reduce the number of traits to the minimum, while distilling the representation to a pure form?

> To reduce the number of traits to the minimum while still distilling the representation of the AI characters' personalities to a pure form, one option could be to use a binary system where each AI character is assigned either a "positive" trait or a "negative" trait.
> 
> For example, the positive traits could include loyalty, altruism, and bravery, while the negative traits could include greed, aggression, and cowardice. This would allow for a clear and concise representation of each AI character's personality, while still providing enough depth and complexity to influence their behavior and decision-making in a meaningful way.
> 
> To further reduce the number of traits, you could consider combining some of the traits into more general categories. For example, rather than having separate traits for loyalty, altruism, and bravery, you could have a single "positive" trait that encompasses all of these qualities. Similarly, rather than having separate traits for greed, aggression, and cowardice, you could have a single "negative" trait that encompasses all of these qualities.
> 
> Overall, the key would be to find the right balance between simplicity and complexity, so that the AI characters' personalities are represented in a clear and concise way, but still have enough depth and nuance to influence their behavior and decision-making in a believable and immersive way.

So each character cam be described as either positive or negative?

> Yes, using a binary system where each AI character is assigned either a "positive" trait or a "negative" trait could be a simple and effective way to represent the personalities of the AI characters.
> 
> The positive traits could represent qualities such as loyalty, altruism, and bravery, while the negative traits could represent qualities such as greed, aggression, and cowardice.

I like that idea. What proportion of the characters should be negative vs. positive, on average?

> The proportion of AI characters with positive vs. negative personality traits will depend on the desired balance and tone of the game.
> 
> If you want the game to have a more positive and cooperative atmosphere, you might consider having a higher proportion of AI characters with positive personality traits. This could encourage players to work together and rely on each other in order to achieve their goals, rather than competing against each other in a more aggressive or selfish manner.
> 
> On the other hand, if you want the game to have a more competitive and cutthroat atmosphere, you might consider having a higher proportion of AI characters with negative personality traits. This could create more tension and conflict between the players and the AI characters, as they try to outmaneuver and outwit each other in order to succeed.
> 
> Ultimately, the best proportion of positive vs. negative AI characters will depend on the desired balance and tone of the game, as well as the preferences and playstyle of the players. It could be helpful to experiment with different ratios and see how they impact the gameplay experience, and then adjust accordingly based on feedback from players.

Do you think it would make for compelling gameplay if each AI character had a 50% chance of being positive or negative? In each round, the distribution might not be exactly 50:50, but overall across rounds it would tend to equal.

> Having each AI character have a 50% chance of being positive or negative could potentially create an interesting and dynamic gameplay experience, as players would have to adapt their strategies and approaches based on the personalities of the AI characters they encounter.

> 
> One way to mitigate this issue could be to provide players with more information or context about the AI characters, so that they can make more informed decisions about how to interact with them.

I think we should have no missions or quests. Also, the player-controlled characters can still have some AI control. Maybe the jobs and duties and regular activities of the character will play out until the player provides input otherwise. Then, once the player has taken over control of the character for the day, the AI will not automatically perform actions until after the player sleeps and allows the character to wake up on their own. The player can not change characters, but can choose when, during the character's daily routine, to take control and alter the actions of the character.

> Removing missions or quests from the game and allowing players to take control of their characters at different points in their daily routines could create a more open-ended and flexible gameplay experience, as players have more freedom to explore the colony and interact with the other characters in a more spontaneous and dynamic way.

> Allowing the player-controlled characters to have some AI control when the player is not actively controlling them could also help to create a more immersive and believable game world, as the characters would still be performing their duties and activities even when the player is not directly controlling them.
> 
> To make this system work, you could consider using a combination of rules and algorithms to govern the behavior and actions of the AI-controlled characters, as well as a set of triggers or conditions that allow the player to take control of their character at different points in their daily routine. For example, you could allow the player to take control of their character whenever they are idle or performing a routine task, or when they are faced with a decision or challenge that requires their input.
> 
> Overall, this approach could create a more open-ended and flexible gameplay experience, as players have more control over the actions and activities of their characters, but are still subject to the constraints and limitations of their character's role and duties within the colony.

That is a good idea, allowing idle behavior to be temporarily overridden by the player, without taken full control of the character, thus allowing the AI control to continue after the small interaction.

Perhaps the player could also make decisions for the character while it is being AI controlled. Declining food options, or quickly pushing a button or flipping a switch as the character walks by, without usurping full control of the character.

The player's control of a character can be seen as a metaphor for psychosis. The player represents the unwilling actions a character may take due to the extreme circumstances.

> Allowing players to make decisions for their characters while they are being AI controlled could create a more interactive and immersive gameplay experience, as players have more opportunities to influence the actions and behaviors of their characters without necessarily taking full control of them.

Change a few things: No missions or quests. Also, no points are awarded. The winner is determined by being the last character alive. Then, the number of times the players died is taken into account, so that the last surviving character might not win if the second-to-last survivor died far fewer times.

Change it so the player's control of the character does not end until the character gets a full night's sleep. Also, mention that this is a competitive online multiplayer game, and mention the game's end condition: last one standing. The last player character alive will be assigned rank 32. If that player died 16 times during the game, this number will be subtracted from the final rank, given an end score of 16. The player with the highest number at the end wins: the player who survived the longest, while dying the least.

How can player-to-player and player-to-AI interactions be managed so that it is not obvious when one is communicating to AI vs player?

> Managing player-to-player and player-to-AI interactions in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish between the two can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that might be useful in achieving this goal:
> 
> - Use natural language processing: One option could be to use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to generate responses for AI-controlled characters that are similar in style and content to those of player-controlled characters. This could make it difficult for players to tell the difference between the two.
> 
> - Use AI-controlled characters to mimic player behavior: Another option could be to use AI-controlled characters that are programmed to mimic the behavior of player-controlled characters. This could involve using machine learning algorithms to analyze the actions and responses of player-controlled characters and using this information to guide the behavior of AI-controlled characters.
> 
> - Use randomized responses: One way to further complicate matters could be to use randomized responses for AI-controlled characters, so that they are not always the same. This could make it more difficult for players to distinguish between the two, as they would not be able to rely on predictable patterns of behavior.
> 
> - Use social cues and interactions: Players might also be able to use social cues and interactions, such as eye contact, body language, and tone of voice, to help distinguish between player-controlled and AI-controlled characters. This could involve using motion capture or other techniques to replicate these cues in the game.
> 
> Overall, there are many different strategies that could be used to manage player-to-player and player-to-AI interactions in a way that makes it difficult for players to distinguish between the two. The specific approach that is most effective will depend on the goals and focus of the game, as well as the resources and capabilities of the development team.

The tone of the game is of living in an oppressive, capitalistic nightmare. One of the rules of the colony might be: no talking. Maybe all players and AI characters will communicate through some other means. Any suggestions?

> If the goal of the game is to create a tone of living in an oppressive, capitalistic nightmare, one approach could be to use a communication system that reflects this theme. Some potential options for communicating without speaking could include:
> 
> - Text-based communication: Players and AI-controlled characters could communicate using text messages or other forms of written communication, such as notes or chat messages. This could be an effective way to convey information and facilitate interactions without relying on spoken words.
> 
> - Nonverbal communication: Players and AI-controlled characters could also communicate using nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, or body language. This could be an effective way to convey meaning and emotion without relying on spoken words.
> 
> - Visual communication: Players and AI-controlled characters might also be able to communicate using visual symbols or other forms of visual communication. This could involve using a system of hand signs, flashing lights, or other visual cues to convey meaning.
> 
> - Audio-based communication: Players and AI-controlled characters might also be able to communicate using audio-based methods such as whistle codes, Morse code, or other forms of audio communication. This could be an effective way to convey meaning and emotion without relying on spoken words.

How can the specific game mechanics of each task work? I want the AI to be very good at these tasks, and for it to be somewhat cryptic for the player to figure out the exact correct method. Perhaps a specific sequence of button presses, using specific tools, and inputting specific input ingredients/components would be required. If the player gets it close enough, a substandard product could be made. The player would need to either watch the AI and deduce how the task is performed or perhaps reference some in-game instructions.

> There are several approaches that could be taken to design game mechanics for tasks in a way that makes it challenging for players to figure out the exact correct method, while still allowing the AI to be very good at these tasks. Some potential options could include:

> - Complex input requirements: Players could be required to input specific sequences of button presses, use specific tools, or input specific ingredients or components in order to complete tasks. This could make it more challenging for players to figure out the exact correct method, as they would need to experiment and pay attention to the details of the task.
> 
> - In-game instructions: Players could be given access to in-game instructions that provide more information about how to complete tasks. These instructions could be hidden or hard to find, or could be presented in a cryptic or misleading way, in order to make it more challenging for players to figure out the correct method.
> 
> - AI demonstration: Players could be given the opportunity to watch the AI perform tasks in order to deduce the correct method. This could involve allowing players to observe the AI from different angles, or to pause and slow down the action in order to get a better look at what is happening.
> 
> - Feedback mechanisms: Players could be given feedback on their progress in completing tasks, such as by displaying a progress bar or other indicator. This could allow players to see how close they are to completing the task correctly, and could help them to figure out what they are doing wrong.

We want these game mechanics to not be overly arduous, a little bit fun, but very prone to failure.

> There are several strategies that could be used to design game mechanics that are not overly arduous, but are still challenging and prone to failure:
> 
> - Use randomization: One option could be to use randomization in the mechanics of tasks in order to make them more challenging and prone to failure. For example, tasks could involve randomly generated ingredients or components that must be used in a specific order, or could require players to complete a series of mini-games or puzzles in order to progress.
> 
> - Use limited resources: Another option could be to use limited resources in the mechanics of tasks in order to make them more challenging and prone to failure. For example, tasks could involve using a limited number of tools or resources, or could require players to manage their time effectively in order to complete them.

> - Use time constraints: Time constraints could also be used to make tasks more challenging and prone to failure. For example, tasks could have a time limit, or could require players to complete them in a specific order within a certain time frame.
> 
> - Use multiple steps: Tasks could also be designed to involve multiple steps or stages, each of which must be completed in order to progress. This could make tasks more challenging and prone to failure, as players would need to manage multiple variables and pay attention to detail in order to complete them successfully.

Do you have any other thoughts or suggestions in regards to this game idea?

> One potential approach that could be taken to make the game more fun and engaging could be to focus on creating interesting and dynamic interactions between players and the AI characters. For example, the AI characters could be programmed to behave in unpredictable or surprising ways, or to react differently to different player actions. This could make the game more challenging and engaging, as players would need to adapt to the changing circumstances and try to outsmart the AI characters.
> 
> Another option could be to include mechanics that encourage players to work together or compete with one another in order to achieve common goals. For example, players could be given the option to form alliances or collaborate with one another in order to complete tasks or accomplish objectives. This could create more social dynamics and encourage players to think strategically about how to work with or against one another in order to win.

The other members of the colony are the people who facilitate the running of the colony, including the Rooks, who represent "the house" and are the VIP hosts to the whales, as well as the bishops, who are represented as the business owners who hold private interests in the food, shopping, and other facilities of the colony. The Knights are in charge of security, but they don't themselves perform any policing duties; robots take care of all direct policing. The pawns are all the low-skilled workers, who tend to the shops and restaurants of the colony, as well as all the manual labor required to run the operation.

Could the word Echelons refer to the progression of the player through the different characters as they die? An Echelon being each new life?

> Yes, the word "Echelon" could refer to the progression of the player through the different characters as they die. An "Echelon" could represent each new life or character that the player controls in the game. This could add an additional layer of strategy to the game, as players must carefully consider how they use each of their lives and how they can best utilize the abilities and resources of each character to survive and eliminate their opponents. The concept of "Echelon" could also emphasize the competitive nature of the game, as players strive to rise through the ranks and outlast their opponents to emerge as the ultimate victor.

Would the singular or plural form of the word be better?

> The singular form "Echelon" might be more appropriate, as it refers to a specific level or rank in an organization or hierarchy. Using the plural form "Echelons" might imply that there are multiple distinct levels or ranks within the game, which might not necessarily be the case. However, using the plural form could also suggest that there are multiple players or groups of players competing within the same hierarchy, which might be an interesting angle to consider. Ultimately, it depends on the specific connotations that you want to associate with the game and how you want to position it in the market.

If the word refers to the progress through each character as the player dies, there is multiple

> Echelons, so the plural form "Echelons" would be more fitting. If the word refers to the ranking system or hierarchy within the game, either singular or plural could work depending on how it is used in the title. For example, "Echelon: Survival and Deception" could refer to the ranking system within the game, while "Echelons of Survival and Deception" could refer to the progression of the player through different characters as they die. It ultimately depends on the context and how the word is used in the title.

Compare this game to the game Among Us. Is it too similar?

> It is difficult to compare this game to Among Us without more information about the specific gameplay mechanics and features of the game. Among Us is a multiplayer social deduction game in which players must identify and eliminate the "imposters" among their group while completing tasks on a spaceship.
> 
> If the game you are describing includes elements of deception, strategy, and multiplayer gameplay, it may share some similarities with Among Us. However, it is ultimately up to the individual player to decide whether or not they consider the two games to be too similar. It is important for game developers to consider the potential for overlap with other games, but it is also important to focus on creating unique and compelling gameplay experiences.

Compare this game we were discussing, Echelons of Deception, with Among Us

> Echelons of Deception and Among Us are both multiplayer games that involve elements of deception and strategy. However, they have some key differences.
> 
> Echelons of Deception is set in a Martian colony and involves players competing to survive and maintain the colony's economy and infrastructure, while also trying to eliminate their opponents through strategic decision-making and deception. It has a third-person perspective and includes character ~~progression and~~ customization options.
> 
> On the other hand, Among Us is set in space and involves players working together to complete tasks on a spaceship while trying to identify and eliminate the "imposters" among them who are trying to sabotage the team. It is a top-down, 2D game and does not have character progression or customization.
> 
> Overall, while both games involve deception and strategy, they have different settings, gameplay mechanics, and perspectives, so they are not too similar.

What might be the ulterior motives of the person or organization who is responsible for this?

> It's impossible for me to speculate on the ulterior motives of a fictional person or organization without more context. However, in the context of the game Echelons of Deception, it is possible that the person or organization responsible for the Martian colony may have various motivations such as financial gain, power, or scientific advancement. They may also have hidden agendas or secrets that players must uncover through gameplay and strategic decision-making.

---

Describe the game's setting and themes

> The game is set in a Martian colony that has been transformed into an outlandish casino resort, complete with robot battle arenas and other unusual attractions. Players must navigate the hostile and unpredictable environment while trying to maintain the colony's economy and infrastructure. They must also deal with the ulterior motives of the person or organization responsible for the colony, and use strategic decision-making and deception to outwit their opponents. The setting and themes of the game are heavily influenced by science fiction and include elements of survival, social stealth, and sandbox gameplay.

How is the game unique compared to other online competitive games?

> One possible way that the game "Echelons of Deception: Survive and Dissemble" could be unique compared to other online competitive games is through its combination of survival and strategic elements with a roleplaying and deception-based gameplay mechanic. The setting of a Martian colony resort casino, complete with malfunctioning equipment and a host of characters with their own abilities and motivations, could also provide a unique and atmospheric backdrop for the game. The character ~~swap~~ mechanic, which allows players to assume control of other characters upon their death, could add an additional layer of strategy and decision-making to the game. Overall, the combination of these elements could create a gameplay experience that stands out from other online competitive games on the market.

How might the food system be implemented in this game? The restaurant could be condensed into one job: cook, waiter, etc. What could the game mechanics be like? How many recipes should their be and how might the mechanic not become too boring?

> In this game, the food system could be implemented by having players take on the role of a cook in a restaurant, where they are responsible for preparing meals for the other players in the colony. The cook could have access to a variety of recipes to choose from, and could use different ingredients and cooking techniques to create unique dishes. The mechanic could involve players gathering resources and using them to craft ingredients and cook dishes, with the quality of the dish affecting the satisfaction of the customers. To avoid boredom, the game could include a variety of recipes to choose from, as well as the ability to unlock new recipes as players progress through the game. Additionally, the mechanic could involve some element of strategy, such as choosing the right recipes to meet the needs and preferences of the customers, or managing limited resources in order to maximize profits.

Can you draw parallels to this game and chess and argue for and against the name "Echelons of Deception and Survival"

> One way that "Echelons of Deception and Survival" could be seen as analogous to chess is in the strategic decision-making and the importance of anticipating and outwitting one's opponent. In chess, players must consider the positions and movements of their pieces and those of their opponent, trying to anticipate and counter their moves in order to ultimately checkmate them. Similarly, in "Echelons of Deception and Survival," players must also consider the actions and strategies of their opponents, using deception and other tactics in order to emerge victorious.
> 
> On the other hand, there are also some differences between chess and "Echelons of Deception and Survival." Chess is a two-player game, while "Echelons of Deception and Survival" is a multiplayer game with potentially many more players. Additionally, chess has a more abstract and timeless quality, while "Echelons of Deception and Survival" is set in a specific, futuristic setting on a Martian colony. These differences could potentially make the name "Echelons of Deception and Survival" less fitting for a game that is trying to evoke the timelessness and universality of chess.

If we were to extract the game mechanics from the setting, tone, and themes, what would be left and what might be a good way to describe it? Would it be more timeless? Would the name Echelons of Deception and Survival apply broadly to a number of settings and themes? How could the name be made more broad, universal, and timeless?

> If we were to extract the game mechanics from the setting, tone, and themes of "Echelons of Deception and Survival," the core gameplay would likely revolve around online competitive survival, strategic decision-making, and deception. These mechanics could potentially be applied to a variety of different settings and themes, although the specific themes and tone of the game might need to be adjusted to fit the new context.
> 
> In terms of making the name more broad, universal, and timeless, one option could be to focus on the core gameplay mechanics rather than specific themes or settings. For example, a name like "Echelon: Strategy and Deception" could potentially apply to a wider range of settings and themes while still capturing the key elements of the game. Alternatively, the name could be made more broad by omitting specific themes or settings altogether, such as "Echelon: Online Survival Game." Ultimately, the best name will depend on the specific goals and focus of the game.

Looks pretty good so far. Let's discuss and change a few things. I will provide comments and refer to each item by its number in the list you just provided.

1. This is right, but it's not a strategy game. I don't know exactly what to call the genre. It is some kind of competitive third-person RPG, with survival and battle-royale elements, social stealth mechanics, immersive sim economic simulation, and serious/non-serious RP. We should mention the first setting: Martian gambling colony. The name of this setting/map/level will be called "Misirlou" and will be the only setting included in the initial release. Castles, modern cities, post-apocalyptic, or other scenarios will come in the future.

2. The game is not at all a turn based strategy game. It's more like I mentioned in the previous comments about item 1. The strategies and mechanics are less rigid than presented by you in this item 2. The only goal of the player, in EDS:LOS, is to be the last one surviving, while dying as few times as possible (Each time a player dies, they essentially lose a point, and continue as a new character that was previously controlled by AI exclusively. EDS:LOS is the principle game mode. EDS:TTE is a close second, while the RP mode is more of an extra add-on with a much different experience. EDS:RP will certainly have all the elements of the settings, but there will be no structure really and perhaps the host can set rules and settings more dynamically. But yes, the mechanics and strategies you mention COULD be employed by a player in the game.

3. This is mostly right, but there is not really a concept of "progressing through the game." It is strictly a non-persistent online game. Each round of the game is discrete, and self-contained. There is no single player story. All storytelling is environmental or incidental in art, setting, and the game mechanics. The players create the stories in the actions they choose to take.

4. The characters do not really have any specific strengths or weaknesses. Their stats can be randomly set at the beginning of each round. The characters are merely a vehicle for the players and the AI to explore decisions in the game world. The AI-driven characters will have elements of criminality and other personality traits that will drive emergent encounters and story-like events.

5. There is no such progression system. Perhaps, in future versions, there can be microtransactions to offer different kind of asset styles for the players to offer for sale in their in-game businesses, but it must be kept in mind the mechanics of concealing one's identity. So, sporting a fancy unique custom asset on your player character might not be the best idea if it draws attention from other player characters. For this reason, all add-ons should be incorporated to some extent or another in the base game no matter what. AI-driven characters will have the ability to offer for sale all the available DLC/assets, while new players with no DLC will not be able to offer these items. This is slightly a pay-to-win mechanic, but it's more like pay-to-not-lose and we will give these DLC to the player for free as reward for playing the game, perhaps. This will not be in the first versions, however. The first versions will have all assets just included in the base game and that is it.

6. The art style is more just normal. There is no real stylized element, really. The Misirlou map will include some organic "Generative Design" architecture, but that's not really an overall design choice for the game just a setting based way of story telling and using assets we already have.

7. The soundtrack, especially for the first version with the Misirlou level, will rely ~~heavily~~ on the public domain traditional versions of the song "Misirlou." It is about an Egyptian woman. A mysterious, seductive Egyptian woman. We are building off of the "Lyra Starter Game" from Epic Games in Unreal Engine 5.1. We will have an easter egg, and pay homage to that heritage. "Lyra" could be the name of the Egyptian-like woman. The desert landscape of mars reminds us of the landscape of Egypt. The hypnotic melody of the song Misirlou will be incorporated subtly into background music, etc. The Lyra Starter Game has great sounds to begin with. We will try to remove some of the sci-fi tones of the metasounds, to bring it back to a more human feel.

8. I think this is right. We can offer in-game advertisement, that could fit in with the settings of the game. Also, those microtransactions for assets that players can offer for sale in their in-game businesses. Also, maybe, we can just let players buy more Mars Credits directly with small amounts of real money. Controversial, but maybe interesting. Plays on the themes of gambling, and the dystopia of modern capitalism.

9. Yeah, so far it's just one-person beginner team lol. Trying to bootstrap it, and encourage collaboration. Building off of the Lyra Starter Game, using/re-using as much as we can and as many free assets as we can, developing in the open and having open source licenses on our codebases and assets as much as we can.

> It sounds like the game you're describing has a lot of unique and interesting elements to it! The concept of a competitive third-person RPG with survival and battle-royale elements, social stealth mechanics, and an immersive sim economic simulation is definitely unique and could make for an engaging gameplay experience.
> 
> In terms of the setting, it sounds like the Misirlou map, a Martian gambling colony, will be the main focus for the initial release. The idea of incorporating elements of "Generative Design" architecture into the map to tell a story and use existing assets is a creative approach.
> 
> It's also interesting that the characters in the game do not have specific strengths or weaknesses, and that their stats are randomly set at the beginning of each round. This could add an element of unpredictability to the game and make each round feel different.
> 
> One thing to keep in mind with the microtransactions for assets is that players should still be able to access them through gameplay, and not make it a pay-to-win mechanic. It's also a good idea to consider how the assets might be used to conceal a player's identity in the game, as you mentioned.
> 
> It's great that you're building off of the Lyra Starter Game from Epic Games in Unreal Engine 5.1, and incorporating elements of the song "Misirlou" into the soundtrack to pay homage to the game's inspiration. Using open source licenses for your codebase and assets as much as possible can also be a great way to encourage collaboration and community involvement.
> 
> Overall, it sounds like you have a lot of creative ideas for your game, and I wish you the best of luck in its development!
