### Introduction

*Echelons of Deception and Survival* is a competitive third-person roleplaying game with elements of survival, social stealth, immersive simulation, and battle-royale.

### ChatGPT

#### Prompts

> The game is called Echelons of Deception and Survival, and it s a third-person competitive online RPG with elements of survival and battle-royale, social-stealth mechanics,  immersive sim economic simulation, and serious/non-serious RP.

> It is a third-person online-only competitive survival battle-royal RPG immersive sim with two main game modes: Last One Standing and Team Target Elimination, and a third free-mode for casual serious and non-serious RP. The first setting that will be introduced as the only setting of the first version of the game will be a Martian gambling resort colony. The gameplay involves roleplaying jobs and tasks around the colony, mostly ultimately catering to the few elite VIP guests. Survival mechanics involve eating, sleeping, etc. There is an effort to discourage the use of direct pvp violence with guns etc, but that potential is always there. The identities of player-controlled opponents is not explicitly revealed. There is an element of mystery in determining who is a player or just an AI-controlled character. There is also strategy surrounding concealment of your identity as a player-controlled character. And, as always, even the player-controlled characters will be driven by game AI automatically. The player can choose to subtly make small decisions without fully overriding control, or if they make too much of a decision or take full control of the character, the player must remain in control until the player gets a full nights rest or takes some psychoactive medication. Some of the roles and jobs that the characters will need to fill are shopkeeper, cook/chef/waiter/food service, weapons manufacturing, robot manufacturing, facility maintenance, garbage removal, sewage system maintenance, logistics (importing goods from earth). There are some upper level roles such as VIP host and security manager, but they are not starting roles for the players. The physical security is all taken care of by extremely lethal humanoid robots. These robots also serve as the rules of play for the gambling operation: robot battle arena. Simple wagers are placed on the outcomes of robot battles. The entire colony is built upon this gambling operation. Massive energy and money is spent keeping this running. Perhaps, in secrecy, some of these robots and weapons are being manufactured in excess and potentially used for some other purpose or sold for profit. This is one of the meanings of the "Echelons of Deception." The entire colony is essential a giant deception, with layers of deception at every layer in between. The rules of the colony will disallow any human from possessing weapons, but of course some people are criminals and will possess them anyway, and some people are VIP and are deemed so important that rules basically don't apply. The rules become very selectively enforced: mostly as a way to keep the poor servants of the lower echelons of the colony in check.

(There is also maybe a third game mode, hitperson, where each player is given a hit list of people, without any knowledge of who is player or AI, and so each player has all the other players on their list but they don't know which ones...)

### Notebook Notes

#### Unsorted

- Roles mapped to chess pieces — 32 Characters total
  - Upper echelon: Kings, Queens, Rooks, Knights, Bishops — VIP Whales, Operations Management, Security Management, Small Business Operators
  - Lower echelon: Pawns — Workers
- Mental health is modeled with medication as a pickup to buff/debuff certain stats simultaneously (restores mental health with side effects)
- Picture the routines of all the specific jobs/roles
- Characters must sleep  
  - While sleeping characters/players can use their electornic device (phone, "mental probe" implant, etc.) to perform online shopping and other activities
  - AI-controlled characters can also do this automatically to some extent
  - This mechanic adds to the narrative as well as gives players something to do when the character is sleeping
  - Perhaps sleeping pills are required to do activities while sleeping
  - Maybe other types of pills allow a character to forgoe sleep with some debuff side-effect
- Maybe the Knights are more like dedicated security/bodyguards for the VIP whales
- Currency? Digital/Cash?
  - "Mars Credits"?
  - Proxy?
    - Diamonds?
    - Bullets?
    - Pills?
    - Spices?
    - Booze?
- Chat? Voice? Text?
  - "SMS" via phone or "mental probe" implant?
- Social Credit?
- Player-paid billboard ads?
- Business reviews?
  - Message to/from businesses?
- Random business names
  - Players name theirs
- Battery on phone or "mental probe" implant depletes
- Camera movement lags AI movement?
- Phone/ID Device can be lost/stolen
  - Phone/ID Device is issued by the casino/house/management/colony
- Entire facility is put under lock down, red lights and sirens, if any glass is broken of the dome, etc.
  - Roof glass breaking mechanism: multiple layers of glass. Shards of glass rain down on characters causing damage. Red alert, lockdown. Always explained away as thankfully all the layers didn't break. Technical side: Glass planels never do break, they just spawn shards of glass for simplicity.
- Throwing system
  - Physical properties like hardness, weight, etc., affect trajectory and damage


#### What is the angle/take of the colony?

- Simply scamming the colonists with exchange rates sending money from earth, converting to Mars Credits and no facility to transfer back to Earth currency.
- Casino/House manipulated the digital currency?
  - Printing money?
- Ulon Mars is the mastermind
  - Mars Gambling Resort, LLC owns and operates entire facility except small independent businesses (which are owned by Mars Gambling Resort, but operated and rented by the Bishops/whomever)
    - VIP Guests Bring the money to keep the wheels greased — tons of it
      - Workers do all the work — tons of it
        - Robots combat as a basis for gambling and as physical security/police.
- "Amazing.com" PRIMO account gives you one-day delivery to Mars from their off-world distribution centers
  - Prices are inflated because Mars
- There is a weapons manufacturing facility and a humanoid robot manufacturing facility
- Ulon Mars has ulterior motives for the entire operation. There is an ultimate echelon of deception which is revealed for the first time when the player is victorious in a round.


#### Monetization

- MTX for players to be able to offer special items *for-sale* in their in-game shops
  - Has gameplay implications — users without assets will not be able to offer certain items for sale, and could reveal their identity easier


#### Mapping to Chess Moves

- Pawn — Worker: limited movement, but with a sneaky en-passant (the strategy employed by players)
- Bishop — Small Business Operators: large range of motion in a certain direction, limited to its domain (some special access, but not an "insider")
- Knight — Special Security: range is limited by policy, but can "pick" targets with special access (like jumping over pieces)
- Rook — House: large range of motion, domain is not limited — all access privileges
- Queen — VIP subset: nearly-unlimited range of motion, but ultimately tied to the King and their limitless resources (charm their way anywhere)
- King — VIP subset: debilitated by the stress and burden of the colony — remorse, sense of being scammed, shame, addictions, mental/physical health problems


#### Unsorted

- Package inspection game mechanic/duty/task/ability
  - A certain role or set of roles has the authority to inspect individual packages in logistics at will, searching for contraband or for any other purpose
  - Package contents are physically laid out and the individual items can be interacted with like normal
- The Weenie is the large structure at the center of the colony, which serves multiple purposes and is a very tall tower
  - The base of the Weenie holds the Emergency Escape Balls which will launch VIPs to safety in case of danger
    - They VIPs climb inside, and are launched into the air, away from the colony, and land back to safety on the Martian surface gently via parachute
      - They will never function when a person is inside — they will parachute perfectly every time they are launched empty
  - The Weenie also supports the protective cup — the glass dome around the colony, which provides the physical barrier to the deadly Martian atmosphere
- Possible mental model of AI/Characters whereby they self-rank themselves in terms of superiority — modelling complexes of narcissists and the opposite
- Mandatory "mental probe" implants (neurolink)

#### Game Types

- Last One Standing
- Team Target Elimination
- Hitpeople
  - All players are secretly hit persons. Crazy Ulon Mars has given them all tailored hit lists which contain some AI characters and also all other player characters, but without knowledge of which is which. Winner is the first to complete their list without getting hitted.

### Discord Ramblings

- going to try and model the npc ai using Maslow's hierarchy, the biopsychosocial model, and the stress and coping model of human behaviour.
- I think the game name will be Ulon Mars
  - and ppl can joke, like they act confused when they hear the name and someone is like "Yeah he changed his name" and they're like oooh yeah yeah ok but we never say the old name lol
