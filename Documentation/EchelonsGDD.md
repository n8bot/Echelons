- The game is called Echelons of Deception and Survival, and it s a third-person competitive online RPG with elements of survival and battle-royale, social-stealth mechanics,  immersive sim economic simulation, and serious/non-serious RP.

- It is a third-person online-only competitive survival battle-royal RPG immersive sim with two main game modes: Last One Standing and Team Target Elimination, and a third free-mode for casual serious and non-serious RP. The first setting that will be introduced as the only setting of the first version of the game will be a Martian gambling resort colony. The gameplay involves roleplaying jobs and tasks around the colony, mostly ultimately catering to the few elite VIP guests. Survival mechanics involve eating, sleeping, etc. There is an effort to discourage the use of direct pvp violence with guns etc, but that potential is always there. The identities of player-controlled opponents is not explicitly revealed. There is an element of mystery in determining who is a player or just an AI-controlled character. There is also strategy surrounding concealment of your identity as a player-controlled character. And, as always, even the player-controlled characters will be driven by game AI automatically. The player can choose to subtly make small decisions without fully overriding control, or if they make too much of a decision or take full control of the character, the player must remain in control until the player gets a full nights rest or takes some psychoactive medication. Some of the roles and jobs that the characters will need to fill are shopkeeper, cook/chef/waiter/food service, weapons manufacturing, robot manufacturing, facility maintenance, garbage removal, sewage system maintenance, logistics (importing goods from earth). There are some upper level roles such as VIP host and security manager, but they are not starting roles for the players. The physical security is all taken care of by extremely lethal humanoid robots. These robots also serve as the rules of play for the gambling operation: robot battle arena. Simple wagers are placed on the outcomes of robot battles. The entire colony is built upon this gambling operation. Massive energy and money is spent keeping this running. Perhaps, in secrecy, some of these robots and weapons are being manufactured in excess and potentially used for some other purpose or sold for profit. This is one of the meanings of the "Echelons of Deception." The entire colony is essential a giant deception, with layers of deception at every layer in between. The rules of the colony will disallow any human from possessing weapons, but of course some people are criminals and will possess them anyway, and some people are VIP and are deemed so important that rules basically don't apply. The rules become very selectively enforced: mostly as a way to keep the poor servants of the lower echelons of the colony in check.

> **Note:** There is also maybe a third game mode, hitperson, where each player is given a hit list of people, without any knowledge of who is player or AI, and so each player has all the other players on their list but they don't know which ones...

These notes are transcribed from handwritten notes, in the order they appear in the notebook. The order is not logical.


#### Unsorted

- Roles mapped to chess pieces — 32 Characters total
  - Upper echelon: Kings, Queens, Rooks, Knights, Bishops — VIP Whales, Operations Management, Security Management, Small Business Operators
  - Lower echelon: Pawns — Workers
- Mental health is modeled with medication as a pickup to buff/debuff certain stats simultaneously (restores mental health with side effects)
- Picture the routines of all the specific jobs/roles
- Characters must sleep  
  - While sleeping characters/players can use their electornic device (phone, "mental probe" implant, etc.) to perform online shopping and other activities
  - AI-controlled characters can also do this automatically to some extent
  - This mechanic adds to the narrative as well as gives players something to do when the character is sleeping
  - Perhaps sleeping pills are required to do activities while sleeping
  - Maybe other types of pills allow a character to forgoe sleep with some debuff side-effect
- Maybe the Knights are more like dedicated security/bodyguards for the VIP whales
- Currency? Digital/Cash?
  - "Mars Credits"?
  - Proxy?
    - Diamonds?
    - Bullets?
    - Pills?
    - Spices?
    - Booze?
- Chat? Voice? Text?
  - "SMS" via phone or "mental probe" implant?
- Social Credit?
- Player-paid billboard ads?
- Business reviews?
  - Message to/from businesses?
- Random business names
  - Players name theirs
- Battery on phone or "mental probe" implant depletes
- Camera movement lags AI movement?
- Phone/ID Device can be lost/stolen
  - Phone/ID Device is issued by the casino/house/management/colony
- Entire facility is put under lock down, red lights and sirens, if any glass is broken of the dome, etc.
  - Roof glass breaking mechanism: multiple layers of glass. Shards of glass rain down on characters causing damage. Red alert, lockdown. Always explained away as thankfully all the layers didn't break. Technical side: Glass planels never do break, they just spawn shards of glass for simplicity.
- Throwing system
  - Physical properties like hardness, weight, etc., affect trajectory and damage


#### What is the angle/take of the colony?

- Simply scamming the colonists with exchange rates sending money from earth, converting to Mars Credits and no facility to transfer back to Earth currency.
- Casino/House manipulated the digital currency?
  - Printing money?
- Ulon Mars is the mastermind
  - Mars Gambling Resort, LLC owns and operates entire facility except small independent businesses (which are owned by Mars Gambling Resort, but operated and rented by the Bishops/whomever)
    - VIP Guests Bring the money to keep the wheels greased — tons of it
      - Workers do all the work — tons of it
        - Robots combat as a basis for gambling and as physical security/police.
- "Amazing.com" PRIMO account gives you one-day delivery to Mars from their off-world distribution centers
  - Prices are inflated because Mars
- There is a weapons manufacturing facility and a humanoid robot manufacturing facility
- Ulon Mars has ulterior motives for the entire operation. There is an ultimate echelon of deception which is revealed for the first time when the player is victorious in a round.


#### Monetization

- MTX for players to be able to offer special items *for-sale* in their in-game shops
  - Has gameplay implications — users without assets will not be able to offer certain items for sale, and could reveal their identity easier


#### Mapping to Chess Moves

- Pawn — Worker: limited movement, but with a sneaky en-passant (the strategy employed by players)
- Bishop — Small Business Operators: large range of motion in a certain direction, limited to its domain (some special access, but not an "insider")
- Knight — Special Security: range is limited by policy, but can "pick" targets with special access (like jumping over pieces)
- Rook — House: large range of motion, domain is not limited — all access privileges
- Queen — VIP subset: nearly-unlimited range of motion, but ultimately tied to the King and their limitless resources (charm their way anywhere)
- King — VIP subset: debilitated by the stress and burden of the colony — remorse, sense of being scammed, shame, addictions, mental/physical health problems


#### Unsorted

- Package inspection game mechanic/duty/task/ability
  - A certain role or set of roles has the authority to inspect individual packages in logistics at will, searching for contraband or for any other purpose
  - Package contents are physically laid out and the individual items can be interacted with like normal
- The Weenie is the large structure at the center of the colony, which serves multiple purposes and is a very tall tower
  - The base of the Weenie holds the Emergency Escape Balls which will launch VIPs to safety in case of danger
    - They VIPs climb inside, and are launched into the air, away from the colony, and land back to safety on the Martian surface gently via parachute
      - They will never function when a person is inside — they will parachute perfectly every time they are launched empty
  - The Weenie also supports the protective cup — the glass dome around the colony, which provides the physical barrier to the deadly Martian atmosphere
- Possible mental model of AI/Characters whereby they self-rank themselves in terms of superiority — modelling complexes of narcissists and the opposite
- Mandatory "mental probe" implants (neurolink)

#### Game Types

- Last One Standing
- Team Target Elimination
- Hitpeople
  - All players are secretly hit persons. Crazy Ulon Mars has given them all tailored hit lists which contain some AI characters and also all other player characters, but without knowledge of which is which. Winner is the first to complete their list without getting hitted.

### Discord Ramblings

- going to try and model the npc ai using Maslow's hierarchy, the biopsychosocial model, and the stress and coping model of human behaviour.
- I think the game name will be Ulon Mars
  - and ppl can joke, like they act confused when they hear the name and someone is like "Yeah he changed his name" and they're like oooh yeah yeah ok but we never say the old name lol

### More ChatGPT

#### Prompts and Responses

- Can you help me brainstorm job ideas for a role playing multiplayer video game? It will simulate a small martian colony which is run capitalistically as a tourist destination: a casino-style resort that hosts robot gun battles which can be gambled on. There are 32 characters, each vaguely modelled off the 32 chess pieces and pawns. The Kings and Queens are merely the whale guests of the casino. They have been sold a one-way ticket to live the rest of their lives in luxury, gambling on robot battles on mars. The other members of the colony are the people who facilitate the running of the colony. The Rooks represent "the house" and are the VIP hosts to the whales. They are also basically in charge of the whole operation. Then, the bishops are represented as the business owners who hold private interest over the food, shopping, and other facilities of the small martian colony. The Knights are in charge of security, but they don't themselves perform any policing duties. Robots take care of all direct policing: arresting and protecting with weapons. The pawns are all the low-skilled workers, who tend to the shops and restaurants of the colony, as well as all the manual labour required to run the operation: weapons technician, robot technician, electricty/power generation and distribution, facility maintenance, plumbing, glass repair, etc. I need help determining which roles will be essential to the operation of the colony, and provide interesting, dynamic, and fun gameplay for the players and characters.

- Thank you. Keep in mind, this is a small colony on mars. There are only 32 people in total, and the area is small enough that they can walk everywhere. No transportation or cars or vehicles are needed. With that in mind, do you have any more ideas for shops, services, amenities, or essential systems on the colony that would be required for survival?

- How could all of these shops, services, systems, and amenities be presented to the player in a fun and challenging way? Keep in mind, we're making a multiplayer online game that is meant to be competitive. The players would possess the different characters to try and be the last one standing at the end of the round. The score of the players will take into account the number of times they died, and thus switched characters. The last person alive with the least number of deaths is the winner. They will be pre-occupied with survival tasks and other duties around the colony. What would the core game loop be?

> - One way to present the various shops, services, systems, and amenities to the players in a fun and challenging way would be to have them complete tasks and missions related to these aspects of the colony. For example, players could be assigned tasks such as repairing a malfunctioning solar panel array, tending to the plants in the hydroponics farm, or conducting research in the laboratory.
> 
> - In order to make the game more competitive, players could be given rewards for completing tasks and missions successfully, such as points or in-game currency. These rewards could be used to purchase upgrades or items that will help the player survive longer in the game.
> 
> - The core game loop could involve players completing tasks and missions to earn rewards, while also trying to survive as long as possible by avoiding dangers such as attacks from other players or malfunctioning equipment. The player who lasts the longest and has the fewest deaths would be the winner.
> 
> - To make the game more dynamic and interesting, the tasks and missions could be randomly generated or changed on a regular basis, so that players always have something new to do. The colony could also have events or challenges that take place periodically, such as robot battles or survival challenges, which would provide players with additional opportunities to earn rewards and compete against each other.

- Describe the game in full.

> - In this role-playing multiplayer video game, players take on the roles of characters in a small Martian colony that is run as a capitalist resort and tourist destination. The colony features a casino-style resort that hosts robot gun battles which can be gambled on, as well as a variety of shops, services, and amenities such as restaurants, bars, spas, and fitness centers.
> 
> - Players can choose from 32 different characters, each of which is vaguely modeled after a chess piece or pawn. The Kings and Queens are the whale guests of the casino, who have been sold a one-way ticket to live the rest of their lives in luxury on Mars. The Rooks represent "the house" and are the VIP hosts to the whales, while the Bishops are the business owners who hold private interests in the various facilities of the colony. The Knights are in charge of security, while the Pawns are the low-skilled workers who tend to the shops and restaurants, as well as perform all the manual labor required to run the operation.
> 
> - As players progress through the game, they will be given tasks and missions to complete, such as repairing equipment or conducting research in the laboratory. They will also need to survive dangers such as attacks from other players or malfunctioning equipment. The player who lasts the longest and has the fewest deaths will be the winner.
> 
> - To make the game more dynamic and interesting, the tasks and missions will be randomly generated or changed on a regular basis, and the colony will host events and challenges that provide players with additional opportunities to earn rewards and compete against each other. The game will have a strong focus on survival and resource management, as players will need to carefully manage their resources and make strategic decisions to ensure their success.

- The players do not choose the role. They start as a random pawn, who as a randomly-assigned job. The players can change roles only when their current character dies. They then possess the nearest character who is not already possessed by another player.

> - Understood. This adds an additional layer of strategy and risk to the game, as players will need to carefully consider their actions and the potential consequences of those actions. For example, a player may need to weigh the benefits of taking on a high-risk mission with the possibility of a big reward against the risk of losing their current character and having to start over with a new one.
> 
> - To make the game more interesting, the various roles and jobs within the colony could have different abilities and skills that allow them to excel in certain tasks or situations. For example, the Knights may have better combat abilities, making them more effective at defending the colony against threats, while the Pawns may have more specialized skills such as electrical repair or medical treatment, which could be useful in certain situations.
> 
> - Additionally, the various shops, services, and amenities within the colony could offer different benefits or resources to players. For example, the restaurant could provide food and water to help players survive longer, while the laboratory could offer access to advanced technology or research that could give players an edge in certain tasks.
> 
> - Overall, the game would involve a combination of resource management, strategic decision-making, and risk management as players try to survive and thrive within the small Martian colony.

- There is less of a focus on combat. No human characters will be authorized to have weapons, except when providing them to the robots. The robots will provide the physical security. The knights are merely in charge of all the robots. The economic simulation of the game is a key factor. The players actions in performing their task have impacts on the overall economic scenario. If players sabotage their duties. they can indirectly attack opponent players.

- Social stealth will also play a key role in the game. None of the other players are explicitly labelled for the other players. The AI-controlled characters and the player-controlled characters appear the same. A large part of the game will be deducing who is a player character or an AI character, and attempting to hamper the player characters. A player wants their opponents to die more times than they do, so they can be winner at the end. But, directly attacking players will cause the robot guards to quickly defeat the attacking player. Weapons will be scarce in the game, and ammo scarce as well. So lots of deep. covert strategy will be needed to win. Also, there will be a black market that provides goods and services to the characters. Any ideas how to implement that?

> - It sounds like the game will have a strong focus on economic simulation and social stealth, with players having to carefully manage their tasks and resources while also attempting to gather information about their opponents and hinder their progress.
> 
> - To implement the black market, one option could be to have it operate as a separate system within the game that is accessed through a covert interface. Players could use the black market to purchase or sell illegal or rare items, such as weapons or ammunition, at a premium price. Access to the black market could be gained through completing certain tasks or missions, or by earning favor with certain NPCs within the colony.
> 
> - To make the game more challenging and interesting, the black market could be operated by a group of NPCs who are more difficult to deal with than the regular characters in the colony. These NPCs could have their own agendas and motivations, and players would need to be careful in their interactions with them in order to avoid being caught or double-crossed.
> 
> - In addition to the black market, the game could also have other covert systems or activities that players can engage in, such as hacking into the colony's computer systems or sabotaging equipment. These activities could provide players with an edge in the game, but could also come with risks if they are caught by the robot guards or other players.
> 
> - Overall, the game could be a mix of economic simulation, social stealth, and resource management, with players having to balance the need to perform their duties and gather resources with the need to gather information and hinder their opponents in order to emerge as the ultimate winner.

- There will be no quests or missions beyond the basic economic duties of the roles assigned to the character at the time. The story will be emergent based on the actions taken by player-controlled characters. The AI-controlled characters will mostly perform their tasks diligently, although some of them will secretly operate in the black market. The AI and Player characters all perform the same actions and tasks, to make the job of distinguishing the two more difficult.

> - Understood. In this case, the game could focus on the emergent story and interactions between the player-controlled and AI-controlled characters as they go about their tasks and duties within the colony. Players would need to carefully observe the actions and behaviors of the other characters in order to try and deduce which ones are controlled by other players and which ones are controlled by the AI.
> 
> - To make the game more challenging and interesting, the AI-controlled characters could have different personalities and behaviors that reflect their role within the colony. For example, the Bishops who are business owners could be more calculating and selfish, while the Pawns who are low-skilled workers could be more desperate and willing to take risks.
> 
> - The game could also have a variety of events or encounters that occur randomly or on a regular basis, which could provide players with opportunities to gather information or disrupt the plans of their opponents. For example, a malfunctioning piece of equipment could cause a temporary shutdown of a key facility, forcing players to scramble to find a solution and possibly revealing information about who is behind the problem.
> 
> - Overall, the game would involve a mix of social stealth, resource management, and observation as players try to gather information and outmaneuver their opponents in order to emerge as the ultimate winner.

- How could these systems be modelled?

> - There are several ways that the systems in this game could be modeled in order to create a challenging and dynamic experience for players.
> 
> - One approach would be to use a simulation-based model, in which the various systems and activities within the colony are simulated in real time based on a set of rules and algorithms. For example, the hydroponics farm could be modeled to produce a certain amount of produce per day based on factors such as the number of plants being grown, the amount of water and nutrients available, and the ambient temperature and light conditions.
> 
> - Another approach could be to use a role-playing game (RPG)-style model, in which the various tasks and activities within the colony are structured as quests or missions that players can choose to undertake. These quests could be generated randomly or based on the actions and decisions of the players, and could involve tasks such as repairing equipment, conducting research, or interacting with NPCs.
> 
> - Alternatively, the game could use a combination of both approaches, with some systems being simulated in real time and others being structured as quests or missions. This would allow for a mix of dynamic, emergent gameplay and more structured, goal-oriented gameplay.
> 
> - Overall, the key to modeling the systems in this game would be to create a balance between complexity and accessibility, so that players feel challenged and engaged, but are not overwhelmed by the various systems and mechanics. This could involve using a range of tools and techniques, such as simulation algorithms, random number generators, and branching dialogue systems, to create a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

- We will take the fully-simulated approach. How can the personality system for the AI characters be modelled?

> - To model the personalities of the AI characters in a fully-simulated game, one option could be to use a combination of rules and algorithms that govern their behavior and decision-making.
> 
> - One approach could be to define a set of personality traits for each AI character, such as greed, ambition, kindness, or cowardice. These traits could be used to influence the decisions and actions of the AI characters, based on the context and circumstances they are facing. For example, an AI character with a greedy personality might be more likely to prioritize their own self-interest over the needs of the colony, while an AI character with a kind personality might be more willing to help others and put the needs of the colony first.
> 
> - Another approach could be to use a dialogue system to allow the AI characters to interact with each other and the player characters in a more natural and lifelike way. This could involve using branching dialogue options, where the AI characters have different responses based on their personality traits and the context of the conversation.
> 
> - Overall, the key to modeling the personalities of the AI characters would be to create a range of realistic and believable behaviors and decision-making processes that are consistent with the personality traits of the characters. This could involve using a combination of rules, algorithms, and dialogue systems to create a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

- There will be no branching dialogue, though there might be some limited transactional interaction between the characters. What would be the most important traits to model for the AI characters?

> - In a game where there is no branching dialogue and limited transactional interaction between the characters, the most important traits to model for the AI characters would likely be those that influence their behavior and decision-making in a more general sense.
> 
> - Some examples of important traits to consider might include:
> 
>   - Loyalty: How loyal is the AI character to the colony and its goals? Are they more likely to prioritize their own interests or the interests of the colony?
> 
>   - Greed: How greedy is the AI character? Are they more likely to prioritize their own financial gain over the needs of the colony?
> 
>   - Altruism: How altruistic is the AI character? Are they more likely to help others and put the needs of the colony first?
> 
>   - Aggression: How aggressive is the AI character? Are they more likely to take risks or be confrontational in order to achieve their goals?
> 
>   - Cowardice: How cowardly is the AI character? Are they more likely to avoid risks and back down in the face of danger?
> 
> - These traits could be used to influence the general behavior and decision-making of the AI characters, as well as their responses to events and challenges within the game. For example, an AI character with a greedy personality might be more likely to take risks in order to earn a financial reward, while an AI character with a cowardly personality might be more likely to avoid risks and stick to safer, more predictable tasks.
> 
> - Overall, the key would be to create a range of believable and consistent personality traits that influence the behavior and decision-making of the AI characters in a meaningful way. This could help to make the game more immersive and dynamic, as players have to consider the personalities of the AI characters in their interactions with them.

- How can we reduce the number of traits to the minimum, while distilling the representation to a pure form?

> - To reduce the number of traits to the minimum while still distilling the representation of the AI characters' personalities to a pure form, one option could be to use a binary system where each AI character is assigned either a "positive" trait or a "negative" trait.
> 
> - For example, the positive traits could include loyalty, altruism, and bravery, while the negative traits could include greed, aggression, and cowardice. This would allow for a clear and concise representation of each AI character's personality, while still providing enough depth and complexity to influence their behavior and decision-making in a meaningful way.
> 
> - To further reduce the number of traits, you could consider combining some of the traits into more general categories. For example, rather than having separate traits for loyalty, altruism, and bravery, you could have a single "positive" trait that encompasses all of these qualities. Similarly, rather than having separate traits for greed, aggression, and cowardice, you could have a single "negative" trait that encompasses all of these qualities.
> 
> - Overall, the key would be to find the right balance between simplicity and complexity, so that the AI characters' personalities are represented in a clear and concise way, but still have enough depth and nuance to influence their behavior and decision-making in a believable and immersive way.

- So each character cam be described as either positive or negative?

> - Yes, using a binary system where each AI character is assigned either a "positive" trait or a "negative" trait could be a simple and effective way to represent the personalities of the AI characters.
> 
> - The positive traits could represent qualities such as loyalty, altruism, and bravery, while the negative traits could represent qualities such as greed, aggression, and cowardice. These traits could influence the behavior and decision-making of the AI characters in a clear and consistent way, while still providing enough depth and complexity to make the game immersive and dynamic.

> 
> - Overall, this approach would provide a simple and concise way to represent the personalities of the AI characters, while still allowing for enough depth and complexity to create a believable and immersive gameplay experience.

- I like that idea. What proportion of the characters should be negative vs. positive, on average?

> - The proportion of AI characters with positive vs. negative personality traits will depend on the desired balance and tone of the game.
> 
> - If you want the game to have a more positive and cooperative atmosphere, you might consider having a higher proportion of AI characters with positive personality traits. This could encourage players to work together and rely on each other in order to achieve their goals, rather than competing against each other in a more aggressive or selfish manner.
> 
> - On the other hand, if you want the game to have a more competitive and cutthroat atmosphere, you might consider having a higher proportion of AI characters with negative personality traits. This could create more tension and conflict between the players and the AI characters, as they try to outmaneuver and outwit each other in order to succeed.
> 
> - Ultimately, the best proportion of positive vs. negative AI characters will depend on the desired balance and tone of the game, as well as the preferences and playstyle of the players. It could be helpful to experiment with different ratios and see how they impact the gameplay experience, and then adjust accordingly based on feedback from players.

- Do you think it would make for compelling gameplay if each AI character had a 50% chance of being positive or negative? In each round, the distribution might not be exactly 50:50, but overall across rounds it would tend to equal.

> - Having each AI character have a 50% chance of being positive or negative could potentially create an interesting and dynamic gameplay experience, as players would have to adapt their strategies and approaches based on the personalities of the AI characters they encounter.
> 
> - However, it's worth noting that this approach could also introduce an element of randomness or unpredictability to the game, as players would not be able to rely on consistent patterns of behavior from the AI characters. This could make the game more challenging, but it could also make it less strategic and more reliant on luck.
> 
> - One way to mitigate this issue could be to provide players with more information or context about the AI characters, so that they can make more informed decisions about how to interact with them. For example, you could provide players with hints or clues about the personalities of the AI characters based on their appearance, behavior, or dialogue, which could help them to better anticipate how the AI characters will respond in different situations.
> 
> - Overall, whether or not having each AI character have a 50% chance of being positive or negative would make for compelling gameplay will depend on the desired balance and tone of the game, as well as the preferences and playstyle of the players. It could be worth experimenting with this approach and seeing how it impacts the gameplay experience, and then adjusting accordingly based on feedback from players.

- Can you describe the core gameplay loop of this game?

> - The core gameplay loop of this game could involve the following elements:
> 
>   - Players start as a randomly-assigned character and are given a role or job within the colony.
> 
>   - Players perform their assigned duties and tasks, which could involve managing resources, completing quests or missions, or interacting with other characters.
>

- I think we should have no missions or quests. Also, the player-controlled characters can still have some AI control. Maybe the jobs and duties and regular activities of the character will play out until the player provides input otherwise. Then, once the player has taken over control of the character for the day, the AI will not automatically perform actions until after the player sleeps and allows the character to wake up on their own. The player can not change characters, but can choose when, during the character's daily routine, to take control and alter the actions of the character.

> - Removing missions or quests from the game and allowing players to take control of their characters at different points in their daily routines could create a more open-ended and flexible gameplay experience, as players have more freedom to explore the colony and interact with the other characters in a more spontaneous and dynamic way.
> 
> - Allowing the player-controlled characters to have some AI control when the player is not actively controlling them could also help to create a more immersive and believable game world, as the characters would still be performing their duties and activities even when the player is not directly controlling them.
> 
> - To make this system work, you could consider using a combination of rules and algorithms to govern the behavior and actions of the AI-controlled characters, as well as a set of triggers or conditions that allow the player to take control of their character at different points in their daily routine. For example, you could allow the player to take control of their character whenever they are idle or performing a routine task, or when they are faced with a decision or challenge that requires their input.
> 
> - Overall, this approach could create a more open-ended and flexible gameplay experience, as players have more control over the actions and activities of their characters, but are still subject to the constraints and limitations of their character's role and duties within the colony.

- That is a good idea, allowing idle behavior to be temporarily overridden by the player, without taken full control of the character, thus allowing the AI control to continue after the small interaction.

- Perhaps the player could also make decisions for the character while it is being AI controlled. Declining food options, or quickly pushing a button or flipping a switch as the character walks by, without usurping full control of the character.

- The player's control of a character can be seen as a metaphor for psychosis. The player represents the unwilling actions a character may take due to the extreme circumstances.

> - Allowing players to make decisions for their characters while they are being AI controlled could create a more interactive and immersive gameplay experience, as players have more opportunities to influence the actions and behaviors of their characters without necessarily taking full control of them.
> 
> - For example, you could allow players to make simple choices or decisions for their characters while they are performing routine tasks or behaviors, such as declining food options or quickly interacting with objects or controls in the environment. This could help to make the game feel more responsive and dynamic, as players have more agency and control over their characters' actions.
> 
> - Using the player's control of a character as a metaphor for psychosis could also add an interesting layer of depth and meaning to the gameplay experience. This could be used to explore themes of mental health, identity, and the impact of extreme circumstances on an individual's behavior and decision-making.

- Can you summarize the game in full?

> Here is a summary of the game as it has been described:
> 
> In this role-playing multiplayer video game, players assume the roles of characters in a small, capitalistically-run martian colony that serves as a tourist destination and casino-style resort. The colony is home to 32 characters, each loosely modeled after a chess piece or pawn, and is run by a group of players and AI-controlled characters.
> 
> The Kings and Queens are the wealthy, high-rolling guests of the casino, while the Rooks represent "the house" and serve as VIP hosts to the whales. The Bishops are business owners who control private interests in the colony's food, shopping, and other facilities, and the Knights are in charge of security and the maintenance of the robots that provide physical protection and policing for the colony. The Pawns are low-skilled workers who tend to the shops, restaurants, and other facilities, as well as performing all the manual labor required to run the colony, including tasks such as weapons maintenance, robot repair, and facility maintenance.

Change a few things: No missions or quests. Also, no points are awarded. The winner is determined by being the last character alive. Then, the number of times the players died is taken into account, so that the last surviving character might not win if the second-to-last survivor died far fewer times.

Change it so the player's control of the character does not end until the character gets a full night's sleep. Also, mention that this is a competitive online multiplayer game, and mention the game's end condition: last one standing. The last player character alive will be assigned rank 32. If that player died 16 times during the game, this number will be subtracted from the final rank, given an end score of 16. The player with the highest number at the end wins: the player who survived the longest, while dying the least.

What is the genre of the game?

> It is difficult to assign a specific genre to the game you have described, as it combines elements from a variety of different genres. Some of the elements that could potentially be included in the game are:
> 
> 1. Resource management: Players must manage the resources of the colony and make strategic decisions about how to allocate them in order to survive and thrive.
> 
> 1. Social stealth: Players must navigate the complex social dynamics of the colony and use social stealth to avoid drawing attention to themselves, while also trying to sabotage the duties of other characters and cause disasters that will eliminate their opponents.
> 
> 1. Strategy: Players must make strategic decisions about how to interact with the other characters, based on their personalities and the goals of their own character, in order to survive and emerge as the last character standing.
> 
> Overall, the game could potentially be classified as a combination of survival, strategy, and social simulation elements, with a focus on resource management, social stealth, and strategic decision-making.

Players could also potentially steal or otherwise acquire weapons and directly attack the other players. They would encounter resistance from the robot guards, but they could also perhaps be defeated or disabled with some type of strategy. As players move from one character to another as they die, they could perform different actions as each character to set up a favorable scenario for them to win as a subsequent character.

> It sounds like you are suggesting the addition of combat and resource acquisition elements to the game. This would add a new layer of strategy and decision-making for players, as they would have to weigh the risks and rewards of directly attacking other players or attempting to acquire weapons.
> 
> Players who decide to pursue a more combative approach would have to be careful to avoid attracting the attention of the robot guards, which could lead to their character's death. They would also have to consider the potential consequences of their actions, as attacking other players or attempting to acquire weapons could also draw the attention of other characters and potentially lead to retaliatory attacks.
> 
> In addition to these elements, players could also potentially use their actions as one character to set up a favorable scenario for themselves when they assume the role of a different character later in the game. This would require careful planning and strategic thinking, as players would have to anticipate the actions and needs of their future characters and set up the resources and conditions that will allow them to succeed.
> 
> Overall, the inclusion of combat and resource acquisition elements would add an additional level of depth and complexity to the game, and would give players more options for how they want to approach their gameplay experience.

The consequences of decisions should also be apparent in the economic simulation. As characters die, less duties are being performed. Supply can dwindle, and essential systems could fall into disrepair. Players must balance the cost and benefit of all their actions throughout the round.

> It sounds like you are suggesting that the actions and decisions of the players should have a direct impact on the economic simulation of the colony.

> 
> The consequences of player actions could also be amplified as characters die and fewer duties are being performed, leading to a decline in the overall functioning of the colony.

What aspects of the economy of the Martian colony would be important to simulate?

> There are many aspects of the economy of a Martian colony that could be simulated in a game, and the specific factors that are most important to simulate will depend on the goals and focus of the game. Some potential factors to consider might include:
> 
> - Resources: Players would need to manage the availability and allocation of resources such as food, water, fuel, and other essential supplies.
> 
> - Production: Players would need to oversee the production of goods and services in the colony, including the manufacture of equipment, the operation of facilities, and the provision of amenities.
> 
> - Trade: Players may be able to trade resources and goods with other players or AI-controlled characters, and would need to consider the costs and benefits of these exchanges.
> 
> - Consumption: Players would need to consider the consumption patterns of the characters in the colony, including their needs and preferences, and ensure that there are sufficient resources available to meet their demands.
> 
> - Distribution: Players would need to manage the distribution of resources and goods within the colony, ensuring that they are allocated fairly and efficiently.

Which specific commodities, goods, and services, would be needed?

> The specific commodities, goods, and services that are needed in a Martian colony will depend on the specific needs and requirements of the characters living in the colony. Some potential items that might be necessary or desired might include:
> 
> - Food: Characters in the colony will need a source of nourishment, which could be produced using hydroponics or other methods, or could be imported from Earth or other locations.
> 
> - Water: Characters in the colony will need a source of water for drinking, cooking, and other purposes, which could be obtained from local sources or imported from elsewhere.
> 
> - Shelter: Characters will need a place to live, which could be provided by prefabricated housing units or other structures.
> 
> - Power: The colony will need a source of power, which could be generated using solar panels, wind turbines, or other renewable energy sources.
> 
> - Medical care: Characters may need access to medical care, which could be provided by a clinic or hospital.
> 
> - Transportation: Characters may need a way to get around within the colony, which could be provided by a network of pedestrian walkways, vehicles, or other means of transportation.
> 
> - Entertainment: Characters may want access to leisure activities and entertainment, which could be provided by a variety of amenities such as casinos, restaurants, movie theaters, or other facilities.
> 
> Overall, the specific commodities, goods, and services that are needed in a Martian colony will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the characters living there, and will likely vary depending on the size and nature of the colony.

How can player-to-player and player-to-AI interactions be managed so that it is not obvious when one is communicating to AI vs player?

> Managing player-to-player and player-to-AI interactions in a way that makes it difficult to distinguish between the two can be a challenging task, but there are several strategies that might be useful in achieving this goal:
> 
> - Use natural language processing: One option could be to use natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to generate responses for AI-controlled characters that are similar in style and content to those of player-controlled characters. This could make it difficult for players to tell the difference between the two.
> 
> - Use AI-controlled characters to mimic player behavior: Another option could be to use AI-controlled characters that are programmed to mimic the behavior of player-controlled characters. This could involve using machine learning algorithms to analyze the actions and responses of player-controlled characters and using this information to guide the behavior of AI-controlled characters.
> 
> - Use randomized responses: One way to further complicate matters could be to use randomized responses for AI-controlled characters, so that they are not always the same. This could make it more difficult for players to distinguish between the two, as they would not be able to rely on predictable patterns of behavior.
> 
> - Use social cues and interactions: Players might also be able to use social cues and interactions, such as eye contact, body language, and tone of voice, to help distinguish between player-controlled and AI-controlled characters. This could involve using motion capture or other techniques to replicate these cues in the game.
> 
> Overall, there are many different strategies that could be used to manage player-to-player and player-to-AI interactions in a way that makes it difficult for players to distinguish between the two. The specific approach that is most effective will depend on the goals and focus of the game, as well as the resources and capabilities of the development team.

The tone of the game is of living in an oppressive, capitalistic nightmare. One of the rules of the colony might be: no talking. Maybe all players and AI characters will communicate through some other means. Any suggestions?

> If the goal of the game is to create a tone of living in an oppressive, capitalistic nightmare, one approach could be to use a communication system that reflects this theme. Some potential options for communicating without speaking could include:
> 
> - Text-based communication: Players and AI-controlled characters could communicate using text messages or other forms of written communication, such as notes or chat messages. This could be an effective way to convey information and facilitate interactions without relying on spoken words.
> 
> - Nonverbal communication: Players and AI-controlled characters could also communicate using nonverbal cues such as gestures, facial expressions, or body language. This could be an effective way to convey meaning and emotion without relying on spoken words.
> 
> - Visual communication: Players and AI-controlled characters might also be able to communicate using visual symbols or other forms of visual communication. This could involve using a system of hand signs, flashing lights, or other visual cues to convey meaning.
> 
> - Audio-based communication: Players and AI-controlled characters might also be able to communicate using audio-based methods such as whistle codes, Morse code, or other forms of audio communication. This could be an effective way to convey meaning and emotion without relying on spoken words.

How can the specific game mechanics of each task work? I want the AI to be very good at these tasks, and for it to be somewhat cryptic for the player to figure out the exact correct method. Perhaps a specific sequence of button presses, using specific tools, and inputting specific input ingredients/components would be required. If the player gets it close enough, a substandard product could be made. The player would need to either watch the AI and deduce how the task is performed or perhaps reference some in-game instructions.

> There are several approaches that could be taken to design game mechanics for tasks in a way that makes it challenging for players to figure out the exact correct method, while still allowing the AI to be very good at these tasks. Some potential options could include:
> 
> - Complex input requirements: Players could be required to input specific sequences of button presses, use specific tools, or input specific ingredients or components in order to complete tasks. This could make it more challenging for players to figure out the exact correct method, as they would need to experiment and pay attention to the details of the task.
> 
> - In-game instructions: Players could be given access to in-game instructions that provide more information about how to complete tasks.

We want these game mechanics to not be overly arduous, a little bit fun, but very prone to failure.

> There are several strategies that could be used to design game mechanics that are not overly arduous, but are still challenging and prone to failure:
> 
> - Use randomization: One option could be to use randomization in the mechanics of tasks in order to make them more challenging and prone to failure.

Do you have any other thoughts or suggestions in regards to this game idea?

> One potential approach that could be taken to make the game more fun and engaging could be to focus on creating interesting and dynamic interactions between players and the AI characters. For example, the AI characters could be programmed to behave in unpredictable or surprising ways, or to react differently to different player actions. This could make the game more challenging and engaging, as players would need to adapt to the changing circumstances and try to outsmart the AI characters.
> 
> Another option could be to include mechanics that encourage players to work together or compete with one another in order to achieve common goals. For example, players could be given the option to form alliances or collaborate with one another in order to complete tasks or accomplish objectives. This could create more social dynamics and encourage players to think strategically about how to work with or against one another in order to win.

Can you describe this game?

> Sure! Here is a summary of the game:
> 
> "Martian Casino Resort" is a multiplayer online role-playing game set in a simulated small colony on Mars. The colony is run as a capitalist tourist destination, featuring a casino-style resort that hosts robot gun battles which can be gambled on. The game features 32 characters, each modelled after the 32 chess pieces and pawns. The Kings and Queens are wealthy guests who have been sold a one-way ticket to live the rest of their lives in luxury on Mars, while the other members of the colony are the people who facilitate the running of the colony.
> 
> In the game, players possess different characters and are tasked with performing various duties and tasks in order to keep the colony running smoothly. These tasks could include managing resources, building and maintaining facilities, and interacting with other characters in the colony. The players can choose when to take control of their character and alter its actions, or they can allow the AI to control the character's actions. The game has no quests or missions, and the story is emergent based on the actions taken by player-controlled characters.
> 
> The game has a competitive element, as players aim to be the last one standing at the end of the round. The score of the players will take into account the number of times they died, and thus switched characters. Players can sabotage each other's duties and indirectly attack opponent players, but they will encounter resistance from the robot guards if they try to directly attack other players.
> 
> The game has a social stealth aspect, as none of the other players are explicitly labelled for the other players. The AI-controlled characters and the player-controlled characters appear the same, so players must deduce who is an AI character or a player character, and try to hamper the player characters. There is also a black market that provides goods and services to the characters.
> 
> Overall, the game aims to create a dynamic and challenging experience for players, as they navigate the complex systems and interactions of the Martian colony and try to outwit their opponents in order to be the last one standing.

Summarize the game

> The game is a multiplayer online role-playing game set in a small Martian colony that is run as a tourist destination and casino-style resort. The colony is home to 32 characters, each based on a chess piece and representing a specific role in the operation of the colony. The players will assume the role of one of these characters, with the goal of being the last one standing at the end of each round. The game will simulate the economic and social interactions of the characters within the colony, with players able to perform duties, sabotage each other's tasks, and engage in social stealth to try and deduce which characters are controlled by other players. The game will also feature a black market and the use of robots for security and policing. Players will be able to override the AI control of their character and make decisions for them, but will need to balance their actions with the consequences on the overall economic simulation of the colony. The game will be competitive, with the winner being the player who is the last character standing, with the lowest number of deaths.

### Game Idea LyraRP

To build off of Lyra Sample Project…

Multiplayer non-serious economy/crime simulator RP. Players take on a random role of a character in a scenario (town, etc. in this case martian outpost that is privateer-based, capitalist pay your way kinda thing to support Elon Musk’s martian robot fighting league, formerly Unreal Tournaments he bought from Epic Games.

Sarcastic “Server Rules” banner: (Maybe different random banners each time, with similar joke rules)

"Server Rules:"
- No killing
- No guns
- No shooting guns
- No stealing
- No talking
- Go to your job
- No bad behaviour
- No selling stuff without permission from the mods
- No drugs
- No arguing with the mods
- Report to mods (there actually are no mods)
