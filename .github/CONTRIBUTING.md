### General Coding Guidelines

Please follow these guidelines:

- Maintain [Epic Coding Standard](https://docs.unrealengine.com/epic-cplusplus-coding-standard-for-unreal-engine/)

- Refactor existing code before adding a new feature — start new feature only when existing code is refactored and functional

  - Or do not refactor — at minimum, do not mix refactoring and new features in single commits

- Document every aspect of your code as if it will be the first thing someone learned about game/software development — use both code comments and separate markdown files located in `Documentation/`

  - Do not sacrifice readability or good commenting/coding/documentation practices in pursuit of the above — assume a technically proficient newbie
