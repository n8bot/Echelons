# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in security. If a suspected security vulnerability is found, please **do not disclose it publicly** — do not use the GitHub Issues tracker. **Follow the instructions below.**

Only use the below procedures to report issues that *are* security vulnerabilities. If your problem is not security related, use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/issues) tracker instead.

## Supported Versions

### Echelons

The latest project release is the only supported version. See [Echelons GitHub Releases](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/releases).


### Unreal Engine

The Unreal Engine versions supported are as follows:

| UE Version | Supported                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| 5.2.0      | :white_check_mark: *Supported* |
| < 5.2.0    | :x: *Not supported*            |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

### Echelons

To report a suspected security vulnerability in the project itself, use the green **Report a vulnerability** button on the [**Security Advisories**](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/security/advisories) page, found on the **Security** tab of this GitHub repository.

### Unreal Engine

To report a suspected security vulnerability that is within the Unreal Engine source (and thus not directly related to this project), use the instructions found at [Epic Games — **Our Security Approach**](https://www.epicgames.com/site/security).

If your problem with Unreal Engine is not security related, use the instructions found at [Unreal Engine — **How to Report a Bug**](https://www.unrealengine.com/support/report-a-bug).
