# Support

If you need support that is not a bug or feature request, or to discuss a suspected bug or a feature request, start a post in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/discussions) with the appropriate category.

To report a confirmed bug or make a detailed feature request, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/issues), or make a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/pulls).

**For security related concerns, please see our [Security Policy](https://github.com/n8bot/Echelons/security/policy).**


### Unreal Engine

To report a suspected bug that is within the Unreal Engine source (and thus not directly related to this project), use the instructions found at [Unreal Engine — **How to Report a Bug**](https://www.unrealengine.com/support/report-a-bug).

If your problem with Unreal Engine **is security related**, use the instructions found at [Epic Games — **Our Security Approach**](https://www.epicgames.com/site/security), instead.
